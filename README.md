ðŸ“… Week 1 Status

Imported essential libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and Gradio

Extracted and prepared dataset from a ZIP file

Set up initial training pipeline using EfficientNetV2B2 with transfer learning

Defined evaluation metrics: confusion_matrix, classification_report

Began interface setup using Gradio



ðŸ“… Week 2 Status

Completed full training of EfficientNetV2B2

Evaluated model performance with standard metrics

Visualized memory usage trends and garbage collection behavior during training



ðŸ“… Week 3 Status

Switched to a more advanced architecture: EfficientNetV2B3

Performed fine-tuning of top layers to enhance accuracy

Tuned training hyperparameters such as learning rate and dropout

Achieved improved validation accuracy and better generalization over EfficientNetV2B2

Re-evaluated model with updated confusion matrix and visualizations
